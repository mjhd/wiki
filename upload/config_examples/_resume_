Hello all, my name is Matthew Houser, I also go by MJHd online, I'm emailing in response to your Craigslist post looking for a web developer and designer.


So I'll just jump right in...

 A little bit about me: I'm from the San Diego area originally but I just returned from the Bay Area last month. I was at the 42 Silicon Valley campus where I attended for about a year in total. 42's program is a hands-on, intensive software engineering program, the curriculum is composed mostly of project work in C, with a focus on UNIX systems, fundamental programming techniques, and practical problem solving.

 My background is an arc from graphic to web design early on, I have worked as a creative design intern and production designer. At my design internship, I was introduced to WordPress, then made the hard switch to web development and started learning to program. I program in several languages, including PHP, JavaScript, C, bash/UNIX/shell, as well as some Python and Java training. I have been primarily focused on web development for about 5 years, and have been freelancing and working by contract exclusively in web development for just over 3 years. I'm highly experienced in the LEMP/LAMP stack and have a strong working knowledge of NodeJS and the MERN stack, including React front-end development and Node-based applications, as well as general server, systems, and web technology experience including a wide variety of widely used APIs. I have both implemented and used Google Analytics, but would not consider myself an expert with it, and have very little video experience, but I am extensively experienced with everything else requested in your post and always willing to learn.

 Over the past three years, I have built 9 websites, front and back-end, as well as assorted tasks on existing sites, the majority of which were in my contract position at The Impression Chefs. I dialed back my freelance work while in school significantly, and I currently have only one client site and my own personal Amazon affiliate site that I maintain, neither of which consumes any significant amount of time.

 As a freelancer, I was able to work on a wide variety of projects, which include an internally hosted application for local property management firm Mount West Realty to track units, tenants payments and property management agents, as well as store, sort, display data and produce reports. I also did extensive UI/UX development for Apps Freedom, an enterprise workforce platform based in India. The rest of my experience is very assorted and includes fixing WordPress messes, designing HTML emails, small JavaScript and jQuery fixes, a custom image hosting/Adobe Lightroom integration for a photographer, a few data processing gigs and so on...

 Lastly, I do have a strong background in graphic design and still consider myself a skilled visual designer and Photoshop/Illustrator expert. I find design experience is massively helpful to a fullstack developer, who is responsible for, and must imagine, the appearance and behavior of the application as well as it's internal workings. It's also helpful to be able to make your own graphic elements and work with SVG both programmatically and in Illustrator.


 I am actively seeking a web development position in the greater San Diego area. Since returning home, I have decided my freelancing days are over and I'm looking to join a professional team as a developer.



 Here is a good current example of my front-end development approach, a test prototype that I built recently using react and a JSON data storage service, as well as GSAP tweenLite for visual animation. The parameters of the prototype included a strong emphasis on WAI-ARIA/WCAG 2.0 accessibility features:

     live code (ES6 & SCSS): jsfiddle.net/MJHd/ce3eznet
      flattened/transpiled production code:  [ view on rawgit ]


  Here is my only currently active client site:
